This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon error involving zero division and potential type handling issues. The `bug.py` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` presents the corrected version. The error arises when the function attempts to divide by zero; however, the more subtle issue involves the absence of explicit type handling. The solution introduces a check to handle potential division by zero, resulting in a more robust solution.
